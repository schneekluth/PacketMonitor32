# PacketMonitor32 + OLED SSD1306
This is a fork of Spacehuhn's fabulus [PacketMonitor32](https://github.com/schneekluth/PacketMonitor32). Changes were applied to use it with cheap dev boards that have an SSD1306 display included ([like this one](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/Lolin-ESP32-OLED-wemos-for-Arduino-ESP32-OLED-WiFi-Modules-Bluetooth-Dual-ESP-32-ESP-32S/32807531243.html)). The original PacketMonitor code uses a SSD1106 display which causes some glitches on the display when you flash it onto an ESP32 board that has an SSD1306 display.
